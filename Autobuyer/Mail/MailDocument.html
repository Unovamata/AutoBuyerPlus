<li><strong>AutoBuyer Version 0.8V Teaser:</strong>

<li><strong>Wiki:</strong> I'm looking for contributors to help me maintain the wiki.<br />
<ul>
<li>The AutoBuyer+ Experimental version is close to becoming the new LTS version. I would like to have the wiki updated with all the exciting features added in this version! Contact me on Discord at ZenAkiSen.</li>

<li><strong>TNT:</strong>
<ul>
<li>On other news, apparently someone reported to TNT the existence of the extension and boasted about their actions in the Neopets Nation Facebook group.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>I will take stricter security and obfuscation measures to protect the integrity of the extension and its users. The extension will keep working as expected. Although, more safely and less <em>open</em> to the public because of these reports. I hope you understand this decision.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is going to happen from now on?</strong> Most things won't change.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Because of the recent statements issued by TNT, I have been studying anti-cheating systems deeply and researched many hours in preparation for this moment, you may see more advanced iterations of AutoBuyer+ including: AI features, obfuscators, and simulators that can bypass and recreate human-like behavior against these anti-cheating systems.</li>
<li>I have already done tests with Neopets' CAPTCHAs to great success! Sadly, I will need time and effort to study these systems, so keep in mind that AutoBuyer+ may go under a period of downtime until I can decipher the measures TNT set in place.</li>
