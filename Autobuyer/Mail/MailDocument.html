<h2>Microsoft Defender&nbsp;AutoBuyer+ Trojan Detection</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you for your continuous support in the development of AutoBuyer+.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Microsoft Defender has issued a false-positive with the release of AutoBuyer+ 0.8v.&nbsp;On March 29th, a couple of users reported AutoBuyer+ being flagged as a&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan:HTML/Obfuse.JSI&amp;threatId=-2147117994">Trojan:HTML/Obfuse.JSI</a></strong>&nbsp;virus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be clear, AutoBuyer+ is not a trojan nor a virus. From the start, we have developed AutoBuyer+ with our users' privacy and integrity at the front, we have been quite vocal about this throughout development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Microsoft Defender mistakenly detected AutoBuyer+ because of these 3 reasons:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>AutoBuyer+ is an automation tool:&nbsp;</strong>Because AutoBuyer+ is sending data to Neopets' servers to automate purchases, this prompted Windows Defender to think that AutoBuyer+ may be sending sensitive data to third-party servers.
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is this not the case?&nbsp;</strong>The file flagged as a Trojan is the "AutoHaggler" process file, which coincidentally, it's the only file that sends data in this format to Neopets' servers, more on this later.</li>
<li><strong>What are the developers going to do about this?&nbsp;</strong>We have deofuscated the script that was causing this issue.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>AutoBuyer+ was heavily obfuscated on version 0.8v:&nbsp;</strong>You may remember that some&nbsp;time ago, we discussed through a mail about a user that reported AutoBuyer+ to TNT's staff members in a Neopets Facebook group.&nbsp;<br />
<ol>
<li><strong>Why did we take this decision?&nbsp;</strong>TNT could easily deploy systems to detect the extension based on its structure, obfuscating AutoBuyer+ was the only way of protecting our users in the long run.</li>
<li><strong>Why didn't you take this decision sooner?&nbsp;</strong>It wasn't necessary at the time, Neopets has become popular in the past year or so. AutoBuyer+ has been in development for almost 3 years now, it wasn't a pressing concern back when the site was on JumpStart's hands.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Defender is one of the worst Anti-Viruses out there:&nbsp;</strong>While useful for everyday tasks, for&nbsp;something as process intensive, demanding, and complex as automating/botting, Microsoft Defender will&nbsp;suspect about processes like these&nbsp; without taking into account this is a Chrome Extension.
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do you say Microsoft Defender is a bad Anti-Virus? Do you have any proof?&nbsp;</strong>Yes, please check this&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c80004e636ea0ea70f25c6bad6a43f8400e1041f37cbf6c1cb34f15b73e1739d?nocache=1">Virus Total Scan</a></strong>.&nbsp;AutoBuyer+ was tested against 62 Anti-Virus programs, where none of them detected the extension as a threat, <strong>including Microsoft's propietary Anti-Virus.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Why would Microsoft Defender Detect AutoBuyer+ as a Trojan?</strong> Because of the reasons mentioned above and AutoBuyer+ takes some control away from the user. Even though it's inoffensive, you have to accept AutoBuyer+ clicks, opens, and manages information&nbsp;<strong>inside a contained browser environment.</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Why should I trust AutoBuyer+ after this?</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can decide to opt-out from using AutoBuyer+, we will completely understand your decision if so. If anything, it will help us improve in future releases to earn your trust back.</li>
<li>We wanted to be transparent, we could have swept this under the rug and ignore the handful of users experiencing this issue and prompting a quick fix, but our audience doesn't deserve that treatment.</li>
<li>As we have said many times, we are compromised on protecting your accounts, your privacy, and time. We do not condone acccount hacking nor black market shenannigans.</li>
<li>We have deofuscated the file that caused the conflict and we're more than willing to deofuscate more files that may cause similar issues in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can AutoBuyer+ take over my computer or my accounts &amp; side-accounts?</strong>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">No, Google Chrome extensions run in a contained environment. These tools cannot read, modify, or change information in your computer. Executing malicious code is out of the question.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Chromium environments do not allow for much administrative power over the user's machine, so it's close to impossible to cause any harm. <strong>Else Google Chrome's Extension Store would be plagued with viruses and trojans.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Well, what now?&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>First of all, thank you for reading up to this point. We appreciate your understanding, time, and support. At the end of the day, we're just hobbyists trying to automate a very repetitive and grindy MMO.</li>
<li>Please, leave everything to us,&nbsp;we understand that earning your trust back won't be easy, but we are compromised to protect you as our end-user as much as humanly possible.</li>
<li>We don't promise this won't happen again because of the nature of AutoBuyer+, but we will try to minimize any negative impact the extension might provoke. We didn't know this could happen and weren't prepared for it, we deeply apologize for any concern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
