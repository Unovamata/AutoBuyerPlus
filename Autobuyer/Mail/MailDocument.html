<h2>0.8v Release Date - 29/03/2025</h2>
<p>Thank you for your continuous patience and support for AutoBuyer+ version 0.8v. AutoBuyer+ version 0.8v will release&nbsp;on the 29th of March&nbsp;after 10 months of arduous development.</p>
<p>I developed systems to create a scalable and dynamic environment for changes and new features later down the line. Even though this version took many, many months, subsequent releases will not face this issue because of said new framework. This is just the start of AutoBuyer+!</p>

<li><strong>AutoBuyer Version 0.8V:</strong>
<ul>
<li>As you may remember, AutoBuyer+ was originally set to release on New Year's. However, due to unforeseen issues, I decided to delay the release of version 0.8v to ensure security, stability, and polish. I am glad I took the necessary time to bring AutoBuyer+ up to the standard I have long envisioned for the extension.</li>
