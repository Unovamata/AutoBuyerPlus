> **Use the tool at your own risk, do not be greedy.** Research legitimate times and adjust settings based on your ping. Lower the Autobuyer's times if you lose out on too many items, but use the tool responsibly.

## Tips

- Read the Wiki's User Manual pages.
- Read the FAQs that come along with the extension in the **Tools > Github > FAQs** for more information.
- No warnings nor bans have been reported with the usage of AutoBuyer+.
- Firstly, it is essential not to be greedy while restocking. Do not go Auto-Buying for more than 8 hours at a stretch as it may draw Neopets' attention towards your account. Do not overdo it.
- In case you fail to buy an expensive item, do not worry. It is better to keep a low profile and aim for less profitable items. It is not what you stock but how many items you stock. You can choose shops with high profitability or low competition.
- Before activating the ABer, make sure to check all your options carefully. Most of the options are set in milliseconds, so it is best to be cautious while setting them up.
- To search for items that you want to buy from specific shops and create your custom item sniping list, you can use JellyNeo's item databases and play around with the filters their database offers.
